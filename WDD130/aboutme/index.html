    <h2>David Carrillo</h2>
    
    <p>Hi, I'm David Carrillo. I was born in Mexico, but I currently live in Roy, Utah with my family. I have been married since 2018, and we just moved to Utah. I have an associates degree in applied technology, and I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree.</p>
    <p>I have a passion for playing video games and watching Anime and read Manga. Programming my own video games is something I really enjoy, and I have experience with creating games in 2D, 3D, and VR formats. In addition to my hobbies, I love to play with my children. I have a 2-year-old boy and a 10-month-old girl, and spending time with them brings me immense joy.</p>
